1. Print user input to all caps
-------------------------------

variable: userInput = none
variable: upperUserInput = none
1. WHILE userInput is NONE, EMPTY, A NUMBER, or ALREADY CAPPED:
	1. Print out: "What would you like to capitalize?: "
	2. Store user input in userInput variable
2. Use string function to capitalize input and store in upperUserInput
3. Print upperUserInput to screen
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Print out: "What would you like to capitalize? "
2. Store user input in userInput variable
	2a. Error check userInput: if empty, is number or already capped
		ASK AGAIN UNTIL VALID
3. use string function to capitalize input and store in upperUserInput
4. Print upperUserInput to screen




2.Add two user numbers together, print result
---------------------------------------------
variable: num1 = none
variable: mum2 = none
variable: sum = 0

1. Print "What is your first number?: "
2.WHILE num1 is NONE, is EMPTY, or NOT A NUMBER, keep asking question above
	ONCE VALID: store user input in num1
3. Print "What is your second number?: "
4.WHILE num2 is NONE, is EMPTY, or NOT A NUMBER, keep asking question above
	ONCE VALID: store user input in num2
5. sum = num1 + num2
6. print sum




3.Get an unknown amount of numbers from user, add together
-----------------------------------------------------------
variable: addNum = nine
variable: sum = 0
variable: addAnother = YES

1. While addAnother is YES (//while user wants to continue add numbers)
	1. Print out: "Number to add to total: "
	2. While addNum is NONE, is EMPTY, or NOT A NUMBER, keep asking question
		Once valid: store user input to addNum
		sum = sum + addNum
	3. Empty addNum for a new number. addNum = none
	4. Print out: "Do you want to add another number? (YES/NO): "
		-If user input = yes, nothing happens (continue)
		-If anything else, addAnother = NO (break)
2. After addAnother is no longer YES, print sum




4. User defines max number, pirnt out random number between 0 and max,
user choose play again or quit.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
variable: maxNum = none
variable: compNum = none
variable: playAgain = Y

*Set up random generator 
1. While playAgain is Y (while user wants a random number)
	1. Print out: "Give me a maximum whole number: "
	2. While maxNum is NONE, EMPTY, or NOT A NUMBER, keep asking
		Once valid, store user input into maxNum
	3. compNum = random number between 0 and maxNum *look at inclusive/exclusive ends
	4. print compNum
	5. Print out: "Play again? y/n: "
		IF y: do nothing/continue
		If other: playAgain = N, break end of game
2 Print out "Goodbye"
